# HAPI FHIR Playground: Basic Test App

This project is a skeleton project for querying data from the [HAPI FHIR public test server](http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4)

### Getting Started:

### Intermediate Tasks:

* [ ] In `question-task component`, generate a form using the `questionnaire.json` file in the `assests` folder. The form should have validation applied to each input.

* [ ] Using the results from the form, generate a [`answerComponent`](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaireresponse.html). The `answerComponent` should follow the structure outlined in the [Resource Content Section](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaireresponse.html#resource)

* [ ] Display your results at the bottom of the page.

* [ ] Update the `answerComponent` to be mobile-friendly.

* [ ] Commit your work.
